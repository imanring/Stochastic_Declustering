# Stochastic Declustering

This repo holds the code for the implementation of the stochastic declustering algorithm.

```stochastic_declustering.py``` has code for the model with and without marks.

I implemented:

- Model fitting using an EM algorithm

- Model Checking via spatial thinning, process transformation and KS test, and simulation.

- Model visualization.


Several datasets were considered: simulated data, earthquakes dataset, Mexican terrorism, and Boko Haram terrorism.
